# 👋 Hey, I'm Terrance IvyBrown

💻 Full-Stack Developer | 🤖 AI Engineer | 🌐 MERN Specialist | 🚀 Technical Innovator

---

I build production-grade web and AI systems that solve real problems. I combine pragmatic full‑stack engineering with applied machine learning to deliver scalable, maintainable products—from well-architected REST/GraphQL backends to responsive frontends and deployed ML/AI integrations. I enjoy moving projects from prototype to production, optimizing performance, and simplifying developer workflows with automation and infrastructure as code.
